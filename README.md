🏡 Real Estate Market Analysis & Prediction
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of real estate data to identify market trends, investment opportunities, and predictive modeling techniques for housing prices. It utilizes decision trees and statistical techniques to derive actionable insights for developers, investors, and realtors.

📊 Key Insights & Recommendations
🔍 Market Targeting
High-Demand Property Type: Focus on 3-bedroom, two-story homes in “Good” condition.

Marketing Strategy: Emphasize features such as:

Paved driveways

Recent renovations

These features support premium pricing and match family housing demand.

💰 Investment Strategy
Renovation Targets:

Properties in “Bad” condition (5.76% of dataset)

Unrenovated homes (31.86%)

High ROI Potential:

Focus on homes without paved driveways

Leverage renovation to boost value

Outlier Analysis:

Investigate anomalies in SalePrice and LotArea to uncover undervalued properties, possibly in less desirable locations.

🧠 Model Improvement & Feature Engineering
Algorithm Enhancement:

Upgrade Decision Tree depth

Switch to Random Forest for capturing non-linear relationships

Data Transformations:

Apply log-transformation on SalePrice and LotArea to reduce skewness

Key Predictors:

PavedDrive

BedroomAbvGr

OverallCond

🔍 Further Analysis Recommendations
Geolocation Analysis:

Incorporate neighborhood-level data to explain SalePrice vs. LotArea outliers

Macroeconomic Context:

Explore economic factors like interest rates and GDP growth to understand construction spikes (e.g., peak in 2006)

Renovation Impact:

Study the interaction between YearRemodAdd and OverallQual to quantify the price premium of renovations by quality tier
