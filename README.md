The insights provide actionable recommendations for real estate stakeholders. For market targeting, developers and realtors should focus on 3-bedroom, two-story homes in "Good" condition to meet demand for family housing, emphasizing properties with paved driveways and recent renovations in marketing to support premium pricing. Investment strategies should target the 5.76% of properties in "Bad" condition and the 31.86% unrenovated for renovation projects, particularly those without paved driveways, to enhance value, and investigate outliers in SalePrice and LotArea to identify undervalued properties, possibly in less desirable areas. Model improvement involves enhancing the Decision Tree by increasing its depth or using a Random Forest to capture non-linear patterns, applying log-transformation to SalePrice and LotArea to reduce skewness and improve prediction accuracy, and including features like PavedDrive, BedroomAbvGr, and OverallCond in models to better predict high-value properties. Further analysis should examine location-based features (e.g., neighborhood data) to explain SalePrice vs. LotArea outliers, analyze economic conditions (e.g., interest rates, GDP growth) to understand construction trends like the 2006 peak, and explore the interaction between YearRemodAdd and OverallQual to quantify the price premium of renovations across quality levels, refining market strategies and predictive models.
